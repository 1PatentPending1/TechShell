/*
    A function that executes the command. 
    This function might take in a struct that represents the shell command.

    Be sure to consider each of the following:
    1. The execvp() function. 
        This can execute commands that already exist, that is, 
        you don't need to recreate the functionality of 
        the commands on your computer, just the shell.
        Keep in mind that execvp takes over the current process.
    2. The fork() function. 
        This can create a process for execvp to take over.
    3. cd is not a command like ls and mkdir. 
        cd is a toold provided by the shell, 
        so you WILL need to recreate the functionality of cd.
    4. Be sure to handle standard output redirect and standard input redirects here 
        That is, there symbols: > and <. 
        Pipe isn't required but could be a nice addition.
